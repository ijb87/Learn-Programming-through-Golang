Well Gretings webby folk.

So today we are looking at creating an interactive experience over the web with golang.

So how did you all do with the challenge I set? to make some actual interactivity on from the server and actually storing changes to the game.

I found it suprisingly tricky, so well done if you managed it.

I planned on this lesson being a quickish challenge response about and then moving onto cookies and multiuser. 

I expected the challenge I set to be much simpler than it was. Instead I got the entire background structure in place, and only just got as far as updating the templates, to handle that.

The other thing that had to happen was I needed to restructure the code as it was getting unwieldy. This took a bit of the time, but it was totally worth it for being able to grasp the scope of the project.

So todays lessons:
    1. Maintaing Larger projects by restructuring.
    2. Maintaining a Single game object for players to access and change with each interaction.

Next week we will be looking at Templates in more detail, and how to add to them, then Cookies, and multiple users the week after.

Here's how I got on:
