Greetings Webfolk.

So today we are going to begin making this game, Unique CandleStick work online.

Todo this we are going to need to use the net/http module and using the ListenAndServe and HandleFunc methods.

We will need to make a small amount of lazy html to get this to work.

There is a much better way of building html than I'm doing today, I'll save that for next week. For now, I just want to show getting a server up and running. 

But before we do this, we need to look at last weeks challenge. 

Last week, I asked you to make it so the person who won the last round, gets to start first, and then to add an announcement when all thirteen rounds have been played.

Lets get on with it shall we.
