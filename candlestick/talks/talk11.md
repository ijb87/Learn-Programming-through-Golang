Greetings Webby buddies.

Today we are looking at the web side of the game candlestick again. And to do that we are going to use templates to create a VERY simple webpage which will allow exactly 1 user to play the game of Unique Candlestick at a time.

Next week we will be looking at making it work for many users with access to cookies and maintaining session data.

Last week I asked you to play with HTML and to see if you could make a quick, card chooser using the things I had shown you already.

So, lets have a go at getting the choices out this way shall we.
