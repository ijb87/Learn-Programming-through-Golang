Greetings People of the World Wide Web

Welcome to lesson 9 of GOlang for abslute beginners.

Today we should be making the game playable. Last weeks challenge was to make present the user with the 3 cards in thier hand, and ask them using "asker" to get an int from that list of cards. There are actually two ways of doing this, that I think are about equally good. So I'll just do one of them.

After that we should be able to make a 1 player game work by the end of today.

The plan is to ask the user which card they want to play. in turn. Once we know what each player has chosen, we send them to Decide Trick, to see who won, that players score will then be incremented by 1, and we can begin again.

If you have fun, don't forget to like and subscribe. Lets get on with it shall we.
